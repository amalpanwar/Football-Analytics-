# Football-Analytics-
This project will analyse the Scottish Premiership league football data.

##
This project will utilise the Poisson Distribution over football data and generate odd between 2 teams which closely match with BetFair exchange. 
Also it will the predict the goal over test data for both home and away team and top of that it will calculate the result (Home win, Draw and Away win) and compare with the actual result by drawing confusion matrix in order to determine the accuracy.


####Result#####

## It seems prediction of Draw matches is higher because of the teams strength and weakness are too close. However if FTR result calculated  directly by the probability it might change.
